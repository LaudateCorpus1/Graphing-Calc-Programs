Current Equation Prompt and Reset Variables are dependencies(subprograms)

They are required to be installed on the calculator, but do not need to be manually run

*note: Equation slots Y9 and Y0 are used by the programs and are not cleared automatically so user doesn't have to reenter equations after every rerun. 

They do not interfere with graphing unless manually turned on by the user

Y9 - main equation

Y0 - first derivative
